The following instructions are for Claude models. If you are non-Claude, ignore those and go read AGENTS.md.

## Build

```bash
./x build           # debug (uses same signing as release)
./x build --release # release (with optimization on)
./x zygisk build    # standard arm64-v8a APK + arm64 Zygisk module ZIP
# (./x is alias to `cargo xtask` which orchestrates the build process)
```

- **When working in a Git worktree, initialize submodules before starting any work:**
  `git submodule update --init --recursive`. Worktrees do not automatically populate submodule
  contents, and builds will fail when `libs/common/bsh` and `libs/common/reflekt` are empty.
- **When working in a Git worktree, work directly on `dev` unless the user explicitly requests
  another branch or isolated history.** This is because commits made on a detached worktree are not automatically
  transferred by Codex's “local checkout” action and can appear to be lost.
- JDK 21
- **Gradle does NOT build the Rust native lib.** `./gradlew assemble*` only packages whatever
  prebuilt `libwekit_native.so` already sits in `app/src/main/jniLibs/<abi>/`. Compiling
  `app/src/main/rust/wekit-native` and refreshing those `.so` files is xtask's job
  (`task_build_native`), so **always go through `./x`** — running Gradle directly will silently ship
  a stale native lib. Requires a Rust toolchain + the Android NDK and its Rust targets;
  `./x configure` regenerates `wekit-native/.cargo/config.toml` from the local NDK and is invoked
  automatically by the build tasks.
- `./x build --native-only` rebuilds just the native lib into `jniLibs/`
- AGP 9, Gradle version catalog in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`

## Project Structure

- `app/` — main Android module, entrypoints, hooks, UI, native Rust lib
- `libs/common/annotation-scanner/` — KSP processors: source-subtype discovery for
  `BaseFeature`/`ExtensionPack` objects plus the `@AgentTool` scanner
- `libs/common/libxposed-api/` — compileOnly LibXposed API interface stubs (compileOnly since they are provided by user's Xposed framework)
- `libs/common/bsh/` — submodule: forked BeanShell interpreter with snapshot serialization (`BshSnapshot`, `BshSnapshotHelper`); snapshots are encrypted AST byte representations used by the WAuxiliary Xposed module; `app/src/main/java/dev/ujhhgtg/wekit/utils/BshSnapshotDecompiler.kt` — decompiles encrypted BeanShell snapshot files back into Java-like source code; the AES key was recovered from WAuxiliary's decompiled source
- `libs/common/reflekt/` — submodule: reflection utility library (`dev.ujhhgtg.reflekt`)
- `libs/common/stubs/` — compileOnly stubs for WeChat and Android hidden classes
- `buildSrc/` — custom Gradle tasks: `GenerateMethodHashesTask` (`IResolveDex` `resolveDex` method MD5 cache), `GenerateNewFeaturesTask` (Kotlin source files added within 30 days of the HEAD commit → `NewFeatures.ADDED_AT_BY_SOURCE_KEY`; KSP joins source keys to discovered features for the 新功能 pseudo-category)
- `xtask/` — build orchestration behind `./x`: native-lib compilation + NDK linker config, APK
  assembly via Gradle, and Zygisk module packaging/flashing

## Entry Points & Architecture

- Xposed entry: `dev.ujhhgtg.wekit.loader.entry.lxp.LxpHookEntry` (libxposed 101 ~ 102) and legacy Xposed API (51+) entry: `dev.ujhhgtg.wekit.loader.entry.xp51.Xp51HookEntry`
- Unified flow: `UnifiedEntryPoint.entry()` → `StartupAgent.startup()` → `WeLauncher.init()`
- Feature objects inherit `BaseFeature`, declare `technicalId`/resource/category metadata as
  override properties, and are auto-discovered by KSP from their source subtype at compile time
- Extension pack objects implement `ExtensionPack`, declare a required `displayOrder`, and are
  auto-discovered by the same KSP processor
- Base classes: `SwitchFeature` (toggle on/off), `ClickableFeature` (toggle on/off with onClick event), `ApiFeature` (always-on), `BaseFeature` (abstract base, do not use directly)
- DEX analysis via DexKit with `IResolveDex` interface; method resolve body MD5-hashed for cache (
  `GenerateMethodHashesTask`)
- DEX-resolved targets DSL: `val methodTarget by dexMethod()` `val classTarget by dexClass()` delegate → `methodTarget.hookBefore { ... }`, `val method: Method = methodTarget.method`, `val clazz = classTarget.clazz`
- UI: Jetpack Compose + Material 3, dialogs written using `showComposeDialog` and
  `AlertDialogContent`; settings screens follow the Material 3 UI Standards section below
  (`ui/content/m3/` widget family, InstallerX-Revived design)
- Config: MMKV via `WePrefs`
- Logging: via `WeLogger`

## Desktop DexKit Validation

- Use `./x dex-test` to run the same `IResolveDex`/DexKit resolution steps used by
  `DexCacheManager.kt` against WeChat APKs on the Linux desktop. Test only the supported host
  range **8.0.65–8.0.77**; APKs outside that range are useful for investigation but must not be
  treated as compatibility gates for the project.
- Test each supported APK version separately, including separate normal and Google Play APKs
  when both are available. Each APK runs in its own JVM worker and must carry its own version code,
  version name, build tag, and Google Play metadata.
- Reports belong under `dex-test-results/<run-id>/` (or an explicitly supplied output directory),
  never under Gradle's `build/reports/`. Preserve the per-APK JSON reports and aggregate summary.
- Resolution classification is strict: an `allowFailure = true` delegate that receives its
  placeholder is `EXPECTED_FAILURE`; an unhandled resolver exception is `UNEXPECTED_FAILURE`;
  delegates that remain pending after that exception are `BLOCKED` and must record the triggering
  delegate; a resolver returning with pending delegates is `INCOMPLETE`.
- A desktop resolution pass does not prove hook-time behavior on a physical device. Initialization,
  worker, native-library, APK metadata, report, unexpected, blocked, or incomplete failures must
  remain visible and make the command fail.
- DexKit desktop testing is intentionally expensive. After a supported-version run has passed,
  do not rerun it for unrelated changes when no Dex declarations or resolution steps changed.
  Rerun the affected supported APK versions after changing `dexMethod`, `dexClass`, `dexField`,
  inline matchers, or the corresponding `resolveDex`/`resolveInlineDex` logic.
- Before reporting a Dex resolver change as complete, run the affected desktop tests plus any
  relevant existing or qualifying Gradle tests (as defined under Testing Strategy), `./x build`,
  and `git diff --check`.

### Host compatibility path selection

- Prefer structure-based compatibility over host-version checks. In Dex resolution, first probe
  one stable class, method, field, or constructor that exists only on the newer path. If that probe
  produces zero results, record its expected placeholder and fall back to the older path. If it is
  present, keep every other required target on that path strict. Multiple results, matcher errors,
  and failures after the probe must remain visible failures; they are not fallback conditions.
- At hook time or when invoking resolved host members, choose the path from the actual resolved
  structure. Use the new-path probe's `isPlaceholder`, inspect the resolved member's reflection
  signature, or test another directly relevant runtime property. Do not repeat the resolver's
  compatibility decision with a host-version comparison.
- If old and new hosts expose the same semantic member with only a signature difference, accept
  the confirmed signatures structurally (for example, `paramCount(10, 11)`). When invocation
  arguments differ, inspect `Method.parameterCount` or `Constructor.parameterCount` and construct
  the arguments from that actual signature.
- Avoid branches based on the WeChat host's `versionCode`, `versionName`, hard-coded WeChat version
  strings, or equivalent version constants. If a host-version check is genuinely unavoidable, ask
  the user for explicit confirmation before adding or retaining it. Distinguishing a Google Play
  build through `isHostGooglePlay`/`isGooglePlay` is **not** a host-version check and does not require
  that confirmation.

## Key Conventions

- Package namespace: `dev.ujhhgtg.wekit`
- Min SDK 28, target SDK 37, compile SDK 37
- Target: WeChat `com.tencent.mm`, versions 8.0.65–8.0.77. Current host info in `HostInfo`
- Device behavior still requires manual testing on real WeChat; desktop JVM tests cover Dex
  resolution only and do not replace device validation.
- Use `WePrefs.prefOption` delegates to declare & use preference items easily.
- Teardown/revert on `onDisable` is **best-effort by design**, not a requirement. Many features
  irreversibly modify the host view tree; fully reverting them would need complex state management
  and syncing for little gain, so having the user restart WeChat is the accepted approach. Do NOT
  report "feature does not undo its changes in `onDisable`" as a bug.
- `allowFailure` on `dexMethod`/`dexClass`/`dexField` is ONLY for structures whose existence
  differs across supported WeChat versions (present in old, absent in new, or vice versa). If a
  declared Dex resolution is expected to succeed on every supported version (8.0.65–8.0.77), do
  NOT set `allowFailure`: a resolution failure must fail that feature loudly instead of silently
  degrading to a no-op.
- JVM reflection over host classes should go through `reflekt` (`libs/common/reflekt/`) by
  default, e.g. `thisObject.reflekt().firstField { ... }` or `.getField(name, true)` — not
  hand-rolled `getDeclaredField`/`getMethod` traversal.
- The libraries `DexKit` and `reflekt` are NOT something you are familiar with. Do NOT hallucinate their API surfaces. Read their code before using them.
- In Compose, `LocalContext` always means the platform context and is never localized by WeKit.
  Use standard Compose resource APIs for composable text and `LocalWeKitLocalizedContext` only
  for imperative WeKit resource reads. Mixed platform/resource operations must read both locals.
  Use `LocalActivity.current` for Activity-only APIs, and never add AndroidX owner forwarding to
  `WeKitLocaleProvider`.
